                  <h3>The History of Amigurumi</h3>
                  <p>
                     Some historians think that the origin of this art can be found in China, where there are records of crocheted and knitted dolls from the Shang dynasty. The craft started to take hold in Japan with the interaction between China and Japan during the Edo period, at the start of the 17th century. Dive into the history here!
