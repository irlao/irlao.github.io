      <h2>About Muli Cafe</h2>
      <div>
         <p>At Muli Cafe we serve everything from warm ube mochi muffins to a classic plate of chicken adobo, as well as other foods and drinks inspired by our upbringing as Filipino-Americans growing up in the Bay Area. We take inspiration from both family tradition and the rich cultures around us.

         After opening up the shop in San Francisco, CA, two hopeful college graduates started their culinary journey together, offering pastries and foods reflective of their childhood spent exploring the boba shops, bakeries, and Asian restaurants of Berkeley, Oakland, and San Jose. Muli Cafe started as a two-man-show in 2021, outsourcing their small but strong lineup of pastries to just six wholesale coffee shops.
      </p>
      <p>At Muli Cafe, we always lead with heart, kindness, and integrity. We instill this principle in everything that we doâ€”every decision we make and every recipe we create. We hope that the cafe becomes a symbol of diversity, inclusiveness, and acceptance. The cafe represents our chosen family, and we want everyone who walks through our doors to be part of our family. Everyone is welcome at our table.
